# Deepdive skip List
## AVL-Tree Properties
 - Easy to understand.
 - Height is limited to log(n), n is total number of tree.
 - Time Complexity: O(log(n)).

## AVL-Tree Problems

 - Lock read node when another tnx update node.
 - After insert or delete node in AVL-Tree, it locks all tree and forces rebalance tree (rotating). 
 - Multi-versioning control not supported.

## Skip List - History

Skip lists were first described in 1989 by William Pugh.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pugh_(computer_scientist)

To quote the author:
    <em>“Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that seem likely to supplant balanced trees as the implementation method of choice for many applications. Skip list algorithms have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced trees and are simpler, faster and use less space”</em>.
