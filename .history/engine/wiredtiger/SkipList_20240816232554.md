# Deepdive skip List
## AVL-Tree Properties
- Easy to understand.
- Height is limited to log(n), n is total number of tree.
- Time Complexity: O(log(n)).

## AVL-Tree Problems

 - Lock read node when another tnx update node.
 - After insert or delete node in AVL-Tree, it locks all tree and forces rebalance tree (rotating). 
 - Multi-versioning control not supported.

    Skip lists were first described in 1989 by William Pugh.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pugh_(computer_scientist)

    To quote the author:
    <em>“Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that seem likely to supplant balanced trees as the implementation method of choice for many applications. Skip list algorithms have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced trees and are simpler, faster and use less space”</em>.

    ## Skip List - Intuition

    - Each point on the horizontal line represents on train stop on a specific street.
    - Following is the map of New York Subway’s “7” train.
    
    - The line at the top is the local train that has much more number of stops compared to the express line on the below it.
    
    - Government decides where to put the stops based on factors like nearby facilities, neighborhood, business centers etc.
     
     - Let’s simplify the above route map and display stations by the street numbers.

    - In the simplified map above, the express line is shown at the top and local line is below it. 
    
    - Now if you had this map and you were supposed to travel from stop 14 to stop 59. 
    -How would you plan your trip route? For simplicity let’s assume we can’t overshoot, meaning that we can’t go some station to the right and then travel back towards left. You would probably want to take the express line from stop 14 and get down on stop 42. Then take the local train from stop 42 and reach the destination 59 from there, as shown below.
